To run all of the questions from the programming section, navigate to /code and run `make && ./LinAl.exe`. To generate the plane visualization, run `plot.py`. 

## Discussion
The most challenging part to implement was the LU decomposition, since the backsubstitution algorithm had a few tricks I had to be aware of. All errors are within machine accuracy for the Guassian elimination and LU decomposition on matrices A & B.
